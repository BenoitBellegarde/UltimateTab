## Description

This app enhances the user experience by being able to link your Spotify account to listen to the track while learning the tab. Moreover, you can also import your Spotify playlists directly into Ultimate Tab to have all the tabs of your favorite songs at your fingertips.

The interface of Ultimate Guitar can be messy, old and with a ton of ads, which can make it challenging to browse tabs. With Ultimate Tab, you can enjoy an ads-free and modern interface to browse tabs, add your favorite ones to your playlist, and listen to the track while learning the tab.
